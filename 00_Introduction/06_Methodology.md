## Methodology

The preparation of this Media and Communication report was based on a qualitative and descriptive approach. Information was collected through a review of academic textbooks, lecture notes, scholarly articles, and credible online open-source resources related to media and communication studies.

Additional insights were gained through critical reading, analysis, and synthesis of relevant materials to ensure accuracy and clarity of concepts. Discussions with peers and reference to course outlines also supported understanding of key topics.

The content was organized systematically using Markdown format to enhance readability, accessibility, and ease of presentation. This methodology ensured that the report reflects both theoretical understanding and practical academic standards in Media and Communication.
